# Game Music Explorer

Demo for Ben Harris, GAMACY Inc.

I don't know of any good repository for game soundtracks. (That doesn't mean it doesn't exist - I'm sure it does and I'm just not aware of it!) Currently, if I wanted to listen to game music, I'd go look it up on YouTube or SoundCloud.

This is a barebones sketch of what a soundtrack repo might look like.
